The project
===========

Over the course of the next three weeks we will be working together to create a clone of rubyflow.com. Our version of rubyflow will be used by alumni to promote any work they are doing, projects they find interesting, etc. RbMU announcements will also be cross-posted to this site.

This is a greenfield project so together we will go through the steps of creating a functioning rails application from the ground up.

A rubyflow "like" site that alumni and staff of RbMU could contribute to. So the idea is if an alumni cuts a new release or adds a feature to their individual project, they would submit that to the flow website. Or if someone writes up a nice article about their core course, that would get added. Official RbMU announcements would get thrown into the mix and highlighted as well, making the flow site a "one stop shop" for what's happening in the RbMU community.
